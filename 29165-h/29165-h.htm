<hr class="quarter" />

<p>Another year. Are we ready for it, ready to work and to win? The
harvest is still plenteous and every increase of store is precious.
Who can measure such privilege? And what of opportunities? The
swift-winged events of our civilization are continually hurrying us
into the midst of them. It is a day of speedy rewards. Christ comes
quickly in these times. The business of the Church is helped as
absolutely as secular business by the development and use of material
agencies for advancement. What is wanted is the good seed of the
word. It is that&mdash;the light which shines forth from <i>that</i>&mdash;which
gives life and growth and masterly power. We want faith in the
promises. It shall be said, "The kingdoms of this world are become
the kingdoms of our Lord and His Christ." The truth of it is not to
be doubted or eclipsed. We want power from on high, and that is
neither distant nor subject to unseasonable delay. What the year
shall be is for us, under God, to determine. Let us labor and pray
that the word of promise&mdash;the divine imbuement&mdash;may make rich and
fruitful, and place the great religious interests of our land on the
foundation of God which standeth sure.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p>We devote considerable space in this number of the <i>Missionary</i> to
the papers and reports presented at the Woman's Meeting held in
connection with our Annual Meeting in Brooklyn. The topics considered
related to the wide range of work conducted by this Association. They
were treated by persons having much experience in our mission fields,
and will be welcomed not only as interesting reading, but as
furnishing authoritative data for the encouragement of the friends of
our work. The constitution proposed at the meeting, for Women's
co-operative societies is given, and is commended to the attention of
those ladies who desire to aid mission work in our own country.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<p>The valuable Paper on "Woman's Work in Modern Charity and Missions,"
read by Rev. A. H. Bradford at our Annual Meeting, not published
elsewhere, has been put in pamphlet form, with a view to general
distribution. We will be pleased to furnish copies gratuitously, in
such numbers as may be desired, to those wishing it for the promotion
of woman's work.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p>We are happy to report that the practice of paying for subscriptions
for the <i>American Missionary</i> is becoming more general year by year.
This is as it should be. We try to make the <i>Missionary</i> worth the
price, which is fifty cents annually. We believe the information it
contains is of value to all, and that most of it cannot be found
elsewhere. Will not our friends kindly aid us in its circulation,
remitting to our treasurer at once what may be gathered for that
purpose?</p>

<h3>JOINT COMMITTEE.</h3>


<p>The Joint Committee appointed by the American Home Missionary Society
and the American Missionary Association for the consideration of the
relation between the two societies, met by adjournment at
Springfield, Mass., Dec. 11. The committee on the part of the A. H.
M. S. consisted of Rev. J. E. Twitchell, D.D., Rev. Lyman Abbott,
D.D., Rev. Geo. L. Walker, D.D., Rev. C. L. Goodell, D.D., and A. S.
Barnes, Esq. The Committee on the part of the A. M. A. consisted of
Rev. J. L. Withrow, D.D., Rev. Washington Gladden, D.D., Rev. D. O.
Mears, D.D., Prest. S. C. Bartlett, and Rev. W. H. Ward, D.D. All
were present except Dr. Goodell, and his place was filled by Mr. S.
B. Capen. A letter from Dr. Goodell was read. Dr. Barrows,
representing the Home Missionary Society, and Dr. Strieby,
representing the American Missionary Association, were also present
by invitation.</p>

<p>It was manifest that the members of the Committee were equally
friends of both societies and sought only their greatest efficiency.
No partisan feeling found utterance. The members of the Committee are
men of independent views and judgment, and examined the subject
before them from different standpoints, and yet reached in the paper
presented below a remarkable degree of unanimity&mdash;every item
receiving a unanimous vote. The result will command and deserves the
attention of the churches. The following is</p>

<div class="center">THE ACTION OF THE COMMITTEE.</div>

<p>Consulting the principle of comity between the two societies&mdash;the A.
H. M. S. and the A. M. A.&mdash;and that traditional policy of
Congregationalists which ignores caste and color lines, and also in
view of the present relative position and strength of the two
societies, we, the Joint Committee, give as our judgment:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
<p>1. That, as heretofore, the principal work of the American Home
Missionary Society should be in the West, and the principal work of
the American Missionary Association should be in the South.</p>

<p>2. Whatever new work may be called for in any locality should be
under the charge of the society already occupying the ground. No
exception to this rule should be allowed unless it be by agreement
between the two societies.</p>

<p>3. Concerning work already established by either society, we would
recommend that if either comity, economy or efficiency will be
advanced by it, such a transfer of the work should be made as shall
bring the work of the societies into harmony with the preceding
recommendations.</p>

<p>4. We would recommend to the two societies to consider the
practicability of using a common superintendent in those portions of
the field where an economical and efficient administration will be
secured by it.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<h3>ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY.</h3>


<p>What can be done with it? We can sustain efficiently our current work
of educating teachers and preachers and the planting of churches. In
the progress of development, more requires more. If the Association
did not need increased receipts it would be evidence of lack of
growth. There is no such lack. New demands are springing up at every
point, and it is wise economy to meet these demands. They are simply
the healthy development of legitimate missionary work.</p>

<p>Just now there is urgent demand for the increase of facilities for
promoting industrial education. The South is arising into a new life.
New fields of labor are rapidly opening. Skilled workmen are wanted.
The possibilities of agricultural prosperity are becoming better
understood. The aspiring youth of both sexes are comprehending their
opportunities, and the industrial departments in connection with our
institutions are patronized as never before. We ought to make the
most of them now.</p>

<p>We need more means for supplying the minds of those hungering for
knowledge with good reading. The colored people have few, if any,
books or periodicals. We ought to have the means at once for
furnishing fifty libraries and reading-rooms at as many different
points. Such help to those willing to help themselves to some extent
should be provided.</p>

<p>The students leaving our schools to go forth as teachers may be
numbered by thousands. These explore the dark places of the land.
They open schools in such buildings as can be found, or, finding
none, teach out of doors. We need means to aid many such with
supplemental support, making it possible for them to continue their
schools longer than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> the few months provided for by the limited State
appropriations. Thousands of dollars could be used wisely in this
way. The opportunity now for temperance work is more promising than
ever. A temperance wave has been sweeping some portions of the South.
Our students are thoroughly indoctrinated in the principles of total
abstinence. They make the best advocates of the cause that can be had
for many localities. It is a crucial period. The time to do this work
is now&mdash;now, while the great questions at issue are being agitated
and settled. We ought to have means for extending our efforts to the
utmost in this direction.</p>

<p>Of more importance still is evangelistic work, supplemental to the
labors of our pastors. This is coming into more than usual
prominence. Our students have had thorough training for it, and no
little experience in it during their course of study. A score of them
in every Southern State could be set to work with profit, if we had
the money for such outlay. Nothing could do more for immediate
results in developing a pure Christianity among the untaught and
unsaved poor of the South.</p>

<p>We might also, with a thousand dollars a day, do more than we have
ever done to foster the growth of right and permanent institutions in
all our fields of labor. This is the great and urgent necessity. Out
of Christian churches and schools will flow all the benefits demanded
by a Christian civilization. For this especially we emphasize our
appeal. To what better use can the Christians and patriots of our
country devote a thousand dollars a day?</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p>A friend, noting the annual average addition of churches as five or
six, raised the question whether the time had not come for doubling
that rate. The Association is glad to recognize this worthy
aspiration and itself to avow the spirit of it, and still further to
remind the friends that the disposition of leaders on the field to
magnify the work of each year is also in the same line. Nevertheless,
we find that those who become in some sense responsible for the
nurture and support of these ecclesiastical children born to us
become conservative instead of becoming rash, as is sometimes
averred. Yet we are able to give assurance that the Field
Superintendent and his associates, with their eyes upon the whole
field, watching the germs and their unfolding, are only anxious to
set out these plants of the Lord's house as fast as is at all
consistent. We also see, in no far-away future, a large church work
for us as the fruitage of our school work.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p>A prize of $75 is given annually to the best male Greek scholar in
the High School at Newport, R. I. The best examination this year was
by the daughter of George Rice, the colored steward of the steamer
Pilgrim. As she was not eligible to the award a gentleman from New
York sent her $75 in gold.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>


<h4>AFRICA.</h4>

<p>&mdash;Among the Belgians no less than six commercial societies have been
constituted to explore the Congo.</p>

<p>&mdash;The Livingstone Inland Mission has founded a new station at Ngoma's
Town, one hundred kilometers up the river from Stanley Pool.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>&mdash;The merchants of Lisbon have constituted a company for the
navigation of the Quanza. They have constructed to this effect in
England a steamer, the Serpa Pinto, which was to be delivered in
September.</p>

<p>&mdash;The Scotch Presbyterian Church have decided to furnish a steamer
for the use of the Old Calabar Mission. The young people throughout
the church have been requested to take up the matter and secure the
money by the time the steamer is ready.</p>

<p>&mdash;According to a dispatch from Sierra Leone the Queen of Massah, with
the consent of the native chiefs, has authorized the annexation of
the neighboring territory of Sherbro to the English possession, which
will thus extend without interruption from Sierra Leone to Liberia.</p>

<p>&mdash;The fever of speculation reigns at Axim and in the districts of the
Golden Coast. From the climate and the conditions of exploration, the
working of the mines proceeds slowly. Commander Cameron, director of
the West African Goldfields Company, has introduced upon his grant
the hydraulic processes employed in California.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>&mdash;The <i>Journal</i> of Geneva announces that the International African
Association is occupied at present in seeking colonists who will
receive gratuitously land in the countries of the Congo, of which
Stanley has taken possession. It is negotiating to attract the
Germans, and already the Prussian journals speak of the creation of a
German Consulate.</p>

<p>&mdash;Flegel has offered to the African German Society to make a new
exploration in a region entirely unknown, which extends to the Congo;
or, if they choose, to return toward the west to Mount Cameroon. The
Government of the German Empire has granted a sum of 50,000 francs
for this exploration. On the other hand, some private individuals of
Lagos, where Flegel has resided since his last voyage, have furnished
him funds with which to conduct an exploration to the basin of the
Niger and to B&eacute;nou&eacute;, in the advancement of science and commerce.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mr. Petersen and Dr. Sims have founded at Stanley Pool a new
station for the Livingstone Inland Mission. Dr. Sims very quickly
commenced to heal the sick, which gained him the confidence of the
natives. These latter do not labor hard enough to produce from their
land the provisions necessary for the number of Europeans established
at Stanley Pool, and the price of provisions has greatly increased.
The steamer, Henry Reed, destined for the Upper Congo was to start
out the first of August.</p>


<h4>THE INDIANS.</h4>

<p>&mdash;Of the 6,000 Pi-Utes it is said that there are never more than 600
on their reservation at one time. Not more than fifty attend the
agency school.</p>

<p>&mdash;The National Indian Association, an organization composed
exclusively of ladies, has for its object to obtain for the Indians
the rights of citizens, and to induce the Government to allow them to
own farms.</p>

<p>&mdash;The General Council of the Choctaw Nation, recently closed,
appropriated $100,000 for the erection of a new council house, the
old one to be used as a manual-labor school for the education and
training in industrial pursuits of fifty orphan boys.</p>

<p>&mdash;The ceremony of receiving Sitting-Bull into the Catholic Church at
Fort Yates has been indefinitely postponed because Sitting-Bull
cannot make up his mind which of his two wives he will let go. Bishop
Marty has had him under his care for several months, and his
instructions were being rapidly absorbed by the Chief; but separation
from his wives proved too much, and he will probably return to
heathenism.</p>


<h4>THE CHINESE.</h4>

<p>&mdash;The missionaries in China, to the number of 231, have presented
another petition to the House of Commons against the infamous opium
traffic.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>&mdash;There is a Chinaman at work in Tahiti, in the South Sea Islands,
who is said to be a whole Bible society in himself, expending twenty
dollars a month out of a salary of twenty-five dollars, for Bibles to
distribute among his countrymen there.</p>

<p>&mdash;The largest bell in the world is in Kiota, Japan. It is 24 feet
high and 16 inches thick at the rim. It is sounded by a suspended
piece of wood, like a battering ram, which strikes it on the outside,
and its booming can be heard for miles. Nobody knows when or by whom
it was cast, and though its surface is covered with characters, no
scholar has yet been able to translate them.</p>

<p>&mdash;The <i>Foreign Missionary</i> says the great secret of success in
teaching the Chinese in America lies in the direct personal influence
of the teacher over the pupil. Generally each pupil is provided with
a teacher, and the chances of spiritual benefit are in direct
proportion to the cordial sympathy and manifest kindness evinced. The
first important revelation that dawns upon the Chinaman is that there
are those in this land who are not hoodlums, and that brutality is
not the universal law in America; that Christianity is higher and
purer than the enactments of Congress, and that Christ is the friend
of all men, and has died for Chinamen as well as "Melicans."</p>

<h3>PAPERS READ AT THE WOMAN'S MEETING IN BROOKLYN.</h3>

<hr class="quarter" />

<h3>THE INDIAN WOMAN.</h3>

<div class="center">BY MRS. A. L. RIGGS.</div>


<p>To describe an Indian woman is no easy task for one who lives among
them, for every peculiarity becomes so familiar, and so interwoven
with our common everyday experience, that we forget how strange and
unlike white women she appeared to us at first. But she is a woman,
even though she wears her shawl over her head and carries her baby on
her back.</p>

<p>How uninteresting, you must think, and she probably thinks the same
of you. She does not know that you care for her. She feels that she
is different in some way, and most likely if you smile upon her she
will not know it, for she is too modest even to look at you; but
speak to her in a pleasant tone and offer to shake hands with her and
notice her baby, and she begins to think that <i>you</i> are a woman. In
her no trace of dignity nor Pocahontas beauty are discernible, but
she is untidy in person and attire, her movements are decidedly
lackadaisical. An uninteresting object, indeed, to one who does not
care to help her. But <i>we</i> believe that she has a woman's heart; and
more than that&mdash;she has a soul.</p>

<p>Her aspirations for herself are limited, but she wants her child to
grow up in the white people's way. Yet how small her conception of
how this is to be accomplished!</p>

<p>She is a heathen&mdash;hemmed in on every side by fear and superstition.
Her gods are gods of fear. She believes in witchcraft, is afraid of a
world full of evil spirits. Under a pagan religion her place is next
to the mere animals. She goes with her husband to the hunt, not as a
companion, but as the drudge, the human pack-horse; she prepares the
food, and her husband devours it regardless of her needs; he may
boast of his "old woman" as being "nina mimi heca" (swift or good to
work) for that is the only accomplishment required in his selfish,
egotistical mind. "The Indian woman comes into the world under a
species of protest&mdash;every Indian parent desiring to have boys, rather
than girls, hence she grows up into a condition of servitude." "In
the Indian nation to purchase a wife is the honorable way, all other
ways are dishonorable, and the man having bought his wife, although
the custom of the country does not allow him to dispose of her to
another, yet he may put her away, or leave her, at his pleasure. He
may also whip her and beat her, for she is his money." I never shall
forget one poor woman who came to me soon after we went to the Indian
country. She showed me her back covered with the marks where her
husband had beaten her.</p>

<p>Now I have given you a brief description of the Indian woman <i>as we
find her</i>. What can be done for her? What would <i>you</i> do for her?
There is only one thing. <i>Help her to become a Christian.</i> This is
not to be accomplished in a hurry, for she is in bondage to her
husband&mdash;to her religion. But faith and prayer, together with a
genuine interest in the Indian home, can accomplish much. Desolate
and comfortless though that home may be, it can be transformed, and
the husband even can be made to see that there is something more
real, something that is more satisfying, something that is more
comforting than this life of fear and bondage to his heathen gods.
"The man has more to give up than the woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> if he becomes a
Christian. If a woman changes her gods and her religion, no one cares
very much; it is 'only a woman.' But a man must abandon his ancestral
faith, which binds him more strongly than the woman, for the very
reason that he is a man, and has been inducted into manhood through
the ceremonies of his religion."</p>

<p>He can be led to see that his wife is worth more to him than his
horse or his dog; and he begins to see that he can do some of the
work which she has been obliged to do, and thus she is enabled to
make home more attractive. With the dawn of Christianity comes the
first effort toward civilized ways. The husband now brings the wood
and water, and little by little a few household conveniences appear,
such as chairs, a table, a few dishes; also knives and forks are used
instead of fingers; even lambrequins are sometimes seen&mdash;hung,
however, in the most absurd way, outside the shades&mdash;and we are
astonished to see in some of the houses white counterpanes and
ruffled pillow-shams. Also a U. S. T. D. blanket is often spread down
for a carpet, and the rude, rough walls are covered with pictures cut
from illustrated newspapers.</p>

<p>We find them ready and anxious to be taught many simple and needful
domestic arts, such as making light bread and preparing wholesome
dishes of food for the sick. The teaching of making light bread
became quite an important part of my duties as a missionary's wife,
and for the Indian women to take lessons in bread-making became quite
fashionable.</p>

<p>Then she shows a desire to dress like white women, and instead of the
broadcloth skirt tied around her waist with a string and the short
calico sack, and moccasins upon her feet, she appears with a kilt
plaiting around her dress skirt, and, what probably in her mind is an
improvement upon white woman's taste, the plaiting is headed with two
or three rows of bright worsted skirt braid. As she admires the thin
and lightly covered head of the white baby, she closely clips her own
baby's hair so as to have it as nearly like a white baby as possible.
But all this is the mere outside of life&mdash;one benefit which
Christianity brings to her personally. She begins to show that she
has become a missionary at heart and that she has a desire to send
this great blessing which has wrought such a change in her home into
other homes; and as others like herself, near at hand, have been
treasuring up the blessed words of the Lord Jesus, "Go ye and preach
my gospel," they begin to think that they can do something to send
the good tidings to those who are in the darkness which so recently
surrounded themselves.</p>

<p>Now, in the Dakota mission, we have thirteen churches, and in every
one a woman's missionary society, and the money raised is used to
support native missionaries&mdash;that is, Christian Indians are sent out
among the heathen Indians as missionaries, and are supported by
Indian societies. The Indian woman's society is conducted very much
like any sewing society among white women. Some woman is appointed to
lead the devotional exercises, and we have our officers appointed
annually. They make children's clothing after the white woman's
fashion, and many useful articles similar to those usually made in
sewing societies. Those women who are able make articles after their
own styles, such as moccasins, pretty bags handsomely ornamented with
porcupine, bead or ribbon work. These articles are gifts to the
society, and we have no difficulty in disposing of them to those who
wish specimens of Indian woman's skill in fancy work, or who may wish
to help this native missionary work which is being so nobly carried
on. Some of these women are really wonderful in their zeal and
faithfulness, walking six, seven, or eight miles to the meeting every
week. I could tell you many things about these faithful Christian
Indian women, but do you wish any better proof of the hold
Christianity has upon Indians?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>As I said before, an Indian woman's aspirations for herself are
limited, but she wants her child to grow up in the white people's
way. Now, if we are to elevate the Indian nation, let us plant in the
homes the desire for the Gospel, and as we do it gather the children
as fast as they are old enough to leave their mother's care into
Christian training schools. Now out in the Indian country we are all
the time carrying on missionary work in the homes, planting schools,
organizing churches, and sending out native missionaries.</p>

<p>We have at Santee Agency, Neb., a large school of advanced grade,
well established for the education of children and youth. So well
known is this school among Christian Indians that our accommodations
have become very limited, and last year we were obliged to refuse
many who wished to come. I think you cannot know how hard it is for
us to say, We cannot take you.</p>

<p>The great Dakota nation is ready to receive the Christian religion.
We have the Bible in the Dakota language&mdash;a monument grand and
beautiful to one who has just gone to his reward. Years of patient,
quiet toil were spent in translating the precious words from the
Greek and the Hebrew into the language of over fifty thousand
savages. Then what hinders the work? We have hymns in the Dakota
tongue. Who will go and sing these precious words to those who never
heard them? There are those who are ready to go, but where is the
money to send them? If you cannot go, what hinders you from sending
some one? To be sure, this is a work of difficulty, for how can we
expect a few years of training to so revolutionize a savage's live
that he can withstand the heathenism which still permeates his native
home? But we have those whom we can trust, and who are filling places
of responsibility and usefulness. Besides those who have gone out as
missionaries and teachers, we have in our school at Santee native
teachers, and our own children are taught by them. One of our pupils
is assistant matron in the Dakota Home. One who has been under our
care is in the little city of Pierre, D. T., giving music lessons to
white pupils. I give only a few instances, to show that we are
beginning to see the results of our work.</p>

<p>Then give the free Gospel of the love of Christ to this great heathen
nation right here so near us. Here is the Bible, here are the hymns;
who will provide the means to scatter them, and who will go to carry
them? We are preparing those who will go with you as assistants and
interpreters. We hear of those who wish to get rid of the Indians;
the surest way to do it is to educate them and Christianize them.</p>

<h3>THE CHINESE.</h3>

<div class="center">EXTRACT FROM ADDRESS OF MRS. W. C. POND.</div>


<p>I will not waste time upon an introduction. I will only say that I am
glad to be among you; glad that you are interested in the Chinese
work, with which we have been connected so many years in California.
We feel that we are greatly privileged in having these dark souls
within our reach. We can obey our Saviour's last command, "Disciple
all nations," without having to go far from our homes and native
land. They are with us and we have but to open our hearts and our
churches to them and they will come in. They <i>are</i> coming in; not in
large numbers but one by one. In the church of which my husband has
been the pastor for nearly ten years there are over seventy Chinese
members&mdash;about one-third of our whole membership.</p>

<p>Many inquire how Chinese converts are tested. They join the Christian
Association on probation and after a test of six or eight months are
recommended to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> the church. Then they come before a committee of the
church and are examined, and after studying the articles of faith, in
their own language, for several weeks they are propounded for church
membership, and if they prove satisfactory are baptized and come into
full fellowship with the church. They are not hurried into the church
and are themselves timid and prefer to wait.</p>

<p>We have no work among the Chinese women that we can call our own.
Both Presbyterians and Methodists have such a work in San Francisco,
and it divides into very little sections what can be at best but a
small work, because there are only three or four hundred Chinese
women in San Francisco, and not a tenth of these accessible. But if
means would allow we would be glad to attempt a work among the women
at Sacramento, where nothing is done for them. With our very limited
resources we can save more by working among the thousands of men and
boys.</p>

<p>But we have much work <i>by women</i> of whom I would like to make
mention. Patient and heroic, prayerful and soul-saving have been
their efforts among the Chinese. I would like to tell you of one who
has recently gone to her reward. Before leaving my home two months
ago I called upon her and found her strength failing. But she was
hopeful respecting her recovery, and the strongest incentive she had
to get well was that she might have more opportunities to tell the
story of Jesus to her boys, as she called those in the Chinese
school. And when death came to her, six Chinese acted as pall-bearers
at her funeral, at her own request. The church was more than half
filled with Chinese, and the scene was touching in the extreme, as
one by one they went to look upon her face for the last time.</p>

<p>You are all, doubtless, more or less familiar with the <i>American
Missionary</i>, and read from time to time Mr. Pond's reports found
therein. I will give a few statistics quoted from my husband's
report, read recently before the General Association of California,
convened in Santa Cruz. They are as follows:</p>

<p>Nineteen schools, as against 15 the last year; total enrollment of
scholars, 2,823, as against 2,567 the former year; 40 teachers, of
whom 14 were Chinese, as against 31 teachers the previous year, of
whom 11 were Chinese; number of those who have professed to cease
from idolatry, 175, as against 156 the year before; number of those
who have given evidence of conversion, 121, as against 106 the former
year, and the whole number of those who have turned to Christ during
the history of the Mission, 400, who are scattered over the United
States and in China. We hear of many of them who are doing good work
for the Master and for the salvation of their countrymen.</p>

<p>Toward the expense of the Mission during the past year the Chinese
themselves have contributed $730.05.</p>

<p>I would like to have you remember the name of our church. It is
"Bethany." Remember us in your prayers, for God has laid a great work
upon us. We started in much weakness, but God has been with us and
blessed us. We have felt His presence in our Bethany as Martha and
Mary of old did in theirs. We have heard the Master's voice saying
unto us frequently, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
least of these, My brethren, ye have done it unto Me."</p>

<h3>MOUNTAIN WHITE WORK IN KENTUCKY.</h3>

<div class="center">BY MRS. A. A. MYERS.</div>


<p>There is an unnoticed class of people dwelling almost in the very
centre of the settled portion of the United States. "Our brother in
black" has been held up to the view of two continents for the last
fifty years. And what is America going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> do with him and for him,
has been a question which has interested the whole civilized world.
This same question for a still longer time has been propounded in
regard to the red man of the forest, and in later years concerning
the Chinese. And right nobly has the Christian brotherhood evidenced
its purpose to make men of these degraded classes. But until recently
it has escaped the notice of these Christian workers that we have
another class as needy perhaps as any. No spice of romance is
connected with them. No barbarous tale of cruelty could be told to
awaken sympathy in them. They are simply poor people, who during
slavery were unable to obtain large plantations and so were driven by
the arrogant Bluegrass slaveholder on the one side, and the greedy
cotton-planter on the other, back into the mountains, where they are
shut away from the rest of the world by mountain barriers, and still
more hopelessly by the haughty caste spirit of the slave-holding
monarchs, who disdain to have anything to do with them except to seek
their votes.</p>

<p>These people are not really poor. Most of them own farms of three or
four hundred acres; and the soil, if properly tilled, would be quite
productive. Their plowing is done in the most primitive manner. A
single horse attached to a little shovel plow simply tears the sod a
little, enough so the weeds spring up luxuriantly, and the women and
children must work hard in the hot sun to destroy them, while the
lord of the home saddles his horse and rides to town, to sit on store
boxes and tell low stories. This people, especially the male portion,
seem to have a natural distaste for labor. They would be aristocratic
if they could. In days of slavery they had their household servants,
and tried to imitate the more wealthy slave-owners by living in
idleness, and they still look upon labor as degrading.</p>

<p>They make no effort to get themselves homes. The large majority live
in log cabins, with no windows. The doors stand open winter and
summer. The women in cool weather always sit with a little shawl
around them and a sunbonnet on.</p>

<p>There are generally two rooms to each house, usually with a chimney
or open hall between them, so you have to go out of doors to pass
from one to the other. In the kitchen (which also serves as
dining-room) is a large fireplace and a cook stove, if they are the
happy possessors of one.</p>

<p>The other is the sitting and sleeping-room. You will often see three
beds and one or two trundle-beds in a single room. Here the whole
family and all the visitors sleep. We have sought to rest with
thirteen of us in a room, perhaps 15 by 20 feet, and not a window in
it and the doors shut. Fortunately the large-mouthed fireplace gave a
pittance of ventilation. No carpets are used, and furniture is very
limited. I believe nine-tenths of the people could put all their
goods on a couple of loads and be ready to move at an hour's notice.</p>

<p>Families are large, numbering twelve, fifteen or even nineteen
children. Girls marry young, and seem to be entirely satisfied with
their condition. You seldom hear a desire expressed for anything they
don't possess. Give them a box of snuff and a stick to chew it with
and you never hear a murmur escape their lips. Tobacco is
indispensable. Old and young, male and female, are wedded to it. I
have known of an old gentleman working all day for fifty cents and
spending forty cents at night for tobacco for himself and wife and
nine children.</p>

<p>They seem to be without a standard in the land. They live so
isolated, and have measured themselves by themselves until they have
lost all idea of accurate judgment. Morality and sobriety are hardly
looked for, even among church members and ministers. "Religion may be
up to fever heat, while morality is down to zero." People "confess,"
as they call it, and join the church, and in their entire life
thereafter you could never know any difference.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>They are satisfied if their names are on the church book. I don't
think they ever question their eternal salvation after they are once
inside a church. If a person dies without having joined a church his
friends frame some theory on which they rest their hope of his
salvation. A young man was shot a little while ago in a drunken
broil. As he fell mortally wounded he cried, "Oh, Lord!" His mother
is sure he is safe because he called on the Lord. They have no
conception of <i>living</i> religion. They have no prayer or conference
meetings. Aside from our own I doubt if there is a prayer meeting
nearer than Berea, seventy miles away. There is no family prayer in
all the land. I asked my class of boys, twenty or more in number, how
many had ever heard their mothers' voice in prayer. Not one of them
could raise a hand. At another school I asked a still larger class
the same question, and only one girl raised her hand. There is no
gathering of the little home nestlings together and instructing
them&mdash;no Bible instruction given in the family. It has ceased to be a
wonder to me, to ask nearly grown boys some of the most simple Bible
questions, and hear them answer, "I don't know."</p>

<p>An M. E. minister in one of his pastoral visits took occasion to
dwell with some stress on the blessedness of <i>walking in the light</i>.
The mother showed how she literalized by promptly remarking, "Yes;
I've told John I wanted a hole sawed in this end of the house, but he
won't do it." During the same call he asked a young lady if she was
preparing to go to judgment. She replied, "No, I reckin I won't go.
If I do I'll have to walk, for we hain't got but two nags, and Rachel
and Becky always ride them."</p>

<p>The prevailing churches are the Reform or Campbellites, the
Methodists, and the Missionary and Anti-Missionary Baptists. The
latter church is strong all through the mountains. They are bigoted
and ignorant, and boast that their knowledge comes direct from the
throne, and they have nothing to do with man-made theories, as they
call education. Their preaching is a sort of canting reiteration of
the text and what few Scripture verses they chance to know and some
hackneyed expressions. They are great on arguing, and it would be
laughable if it was not so pitiful to hear the profound questions
they discuss. Last season one of these preachers nearly broke up one
of our mission Sunday-Schools, which we could attend only each
alternate Sabbath. In the passage that reads "And anon they tell
Him," he contended that A-non was an angel, and <i>they</i> referred to
the angel A-non. Each Sunday when we were not there that important
question had to be discussed.</p>

<p>One of these same preachers took his children from school because
they were taught the heresy in geography that the world is round.
They do all they can to prejudice the people against our work. They
call our religion railroad religion. They are great barriers in our
way. Still we have been cheered this year to see that their hold on
the young people is loosening, and we are getting their hearts in
spite of the protests of their parents. One of our mission
Sunday-Schools, which has averaged this season one hundred, is
composed almost entirely of young people and children, seldom ever a
parent there.</p>

<p>The Smith American Organ Co. have honored God and themselves, and
will ever be held by some hearts in grateful remembrance by their
gift to that society of a new organ. I have some times thought, as I
have heard the young voices ring out with such enthusiasm, that,
though critics might smile at our endeavor, Heaven would not disdain
our offering of praise. The dingy low walls, the glass-less windows,
the tobacco besmeared floor, become transformed to a holy temple,
where God deigned to make visible His presence, and it has been a
sacred place. Our hope of this people centres largely in the young.
If it were not for them, we could not feel it right to stay among
them.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>Another barrier to be overcome is their habits of worship. They have
meetings but once a month during the summer and none at all during
the winter. When they have service it is more for a visit than
worship. Their churches are rough log houses, and so small that the
greater part of the congregation remain out of doors. Four or more
ministers are always in attendance, and all must preach. The
congregation expect a tiresome time, and from the first are restless.
They go out and come in, and they keep a constant march to and from
the water pail, which usually sits on the desk in front of the
speaker. Several grown people at a time will be standing waiting on
each other at the pail. The speaker seems to be used to such things,
and not at all disconcerted. Nearly all their services are funeral
services for those who may have been dead for years. They bury their
dead the same day or the day following death. They have no religious
service, except a prayer at the grave, if there chance to be a
minister present. Generally about a year after death, but often from
five to fifteen years after, they have the funeral sermon preached.</p>

<p>In regard to healthfulness of our mountain home, we have felt
somewhat disappointed. Up so high, with nice springs and spring
streams, one would expect a healthy climate. On the contrary, almost
every one is ailing. Coughs and colds are universal. It is no wonder
the natives are unhealthy; their habits of living would seem to
prohibit health. They eat corn bread or hoe cake and bacon; some have
flour, but it is always made up into hot biscuit, shortened with
lard. They have this, with little variation, three times a day, 365
days in a year. In summer, green beans cooked with bacon is added to
the bill of fare. Of course the blood becomes impoverished, and
almost every one has scrofula. Calomel and pills are the great
panacea for all their bodily ills. Pills are brought on by the quart,
and sold by the merchants like any other commodity. Cleanliness of
the person is an unheard of luxury; I doubt whether they ever bathe.
Children come to the table with unwashed faces. They are put to bed
with the same clothes they wear during the day. Then add to all this
the fact that tobacco is used almost from the cradle, and whiskies
and toddies from the time the poor child opens its eyes to this
world, and it's no great marvel that gray-haired men are exceedingly
rare, and it's the "<i>old man</i>" and the "<i>old woman</i>" when one has
reached the age of twenty-five.</p>

<p>Now comes the question, What are we doing for the people? We have
been with them nearly two years, and this has been our effort from
the first, to get them to see that religion is a life rather than a
sectarian belief. We have sought to impress upon them that joining a
church is not Christianity. We have succeeded in getting a few to
take part in our prayer meetings, and we have the assurance that
<i>all</i> the people are awaking to the fact that God has some demands
upon them. We have from the first kept up regular Thursday night
prayer meetings; have had good attendance, but often only Mr. Myers
and myself to take part in them except as others read Scripture
verses.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath we have Sunday-school at 9:30. Average attendance,
100; preaching at 11. I hasten home, saddle my horse, and ride six
miles to the next railroad station (Pleasant View). Here I have met
100 or more young people. I have been surprised that in a land where
a woman isn't expected to <i>know</i> anything, or <i>be</i> anything but a
doll or a drudge that there has been so little prejudice against my
school. Some, of course, have thought a woman entirely out of her
sphere to undertake such work and have taken occasion to remark to my
friends: "Why, Mrs. Myers opens the school by prayer, just as Mr.
Myers would. I don't know but it's all right, but it don't seem just
the proper thing for a woman to do."</p>

<p>Mr. M. has a mission in South Williamsburg or the mills, where
numbers of children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> are growing up in the midst of gambling and
shooting. Prof. W. has, about the same hour, a school two miles out
in another direction. At night we have services again in
Williamsburg. At these services we have more than can get into the
house, and many are obliged to leave for lack of accommodation.
Tuesday nights we go to Pleasant View and help them learn the Gospel
Songs. Each alternate Wednesday evening, church socials; each
alternate Friday afternoon, Band of Hope; Saturday evening, choir
drill; Covenant Meeting once a month on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Myers has preached during the year beginning with Oct. '82, one
hundred and forty-two sermons. The services, together with the other
public services just mentioned, have amounted to three hundred and
forty. Have attended fifty or more meetings conducted by others. We
spend all the remaining time our strength will permit in calling at
the homes.</p>

<p>We have a neat modern church nearly finished, and so far without
foreign help. But no one knows what an effort has been required. Mr.
Myers would announce a working bee to draw stone or any such work;
would try to enthuse the people as he has so often done in the North.
But when the time would come he has worked all day alone. We have
learned at last that this people don't enthuse.</p>

<p>We are hard at work in our high-school enterprise. We have Prof. and
Mrs. W. and Miss G., all from the North, with us. We hope to get a
school, the good influence of which will never die out of these
mountains.</p>

<p>These are peculiar people. What I have said of them has reference to
the <i>general</i> class of society. But there are some who seem of better
stock, who are shrewd, keen, far-sighted people. You cannot find
their superiors in <i>native</i> ability in any country. Though often
lacking in culture and morality, they still hold a wide influence
over the rest, so that something besides goodness is required in
those who wish to come among them as helpers. There must be ability
to adapt oneself to these widely diverse conditions. One needs wisdom
and tact to get along with the shrewdest, and such a love for souls
that he can come with a helping hand to the most degraded, nor be
discouraged if, with a heart brimful of sympathy, he reaches the hand
a long time only to see it rejected by those most in need.</p>

<p>The work is a work of time. The majority of the people are unstable,
thriftless improvident and ignorant. Slavery left its blight of
impotency and profligacy upon them. They come and go as did their
fathers a hundred years ago. Their tools and utensils are the same
their great-grandparents used, and they are content with them. We
never worked harder and saw less result in the conversion of sinners
than while in Kentucky, and yet never felt more satisfied that we
were where God wants us, and doing an important work. Unless these
people have help they will prove a fretting leprosy in our nation.</p>

<h3>WORK AMONG THE COLORED PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH.</h3>

<div class="center">BY MISS IDA M. BEACH.</div>


<p>No small part of the work undertaken by the A. M. A. is that among
the colored people of the South. Perhaps we may judge something of
how vast this work is in itself, and how far-reaching in its results,
if we consider for a few moments the numbers and condition of the
colored people. Twenty years ago about 4,000,000 people were
liberated from bondage, with all the evils resulting from the system
of slavery resting upon them. There was great rejoicing among lovers
of freedom when the Proclamation of Emancipation was issued. The
slaves themselves, wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> with joy, shouted, "We're free! We're free!
The year of jubilee has come!" Free! yes, free! but with the burdens
of manhood and womanhood suddenly thrust upon them. Freedom brought
the right and opportunity of establishing homes. Glorious privilege!
But do we not all know how much good judgment and wisdom and thought
and planning it takes to maintain a <i>true home</i>? Freedom gave them
the right of keeping their little ones and seeing them grow to
manhood and womanhood, but oh! how much of patience and God-given
power it requires to train the little feet to tread the right way!</p>

<p>Four million people, half civilized, uneducated, untrained, with the
judgment and reason of children, hitherto knowing little of the ways
of the outer world, suddenly brought into life's conflicts! What an
amount of instruction they needed!</p>

<p>Right here the American Missionary Association stepped in and assumed
the work of training these people. Christian men and women, filled
with love for the Master, went down among these lowly ones. They
carried the Gospel of Jesus Christ, established schools and churches,
teaching in the open air, or in rude huts and deserted cabins. For
twenty years this work has been carried on, and much good has been
done in the name of the Lord. But to-day there are between six and
seven million colored people in our Southland. The work of the A. M.
A., together with all done by other societies and by students going
forth from the colleges as teachers, as yet scarcely begins to reach
this great number.</p>

<p>Their first need is to be Christianized, for this alone lifts them up
and gives a desire for better things. It is the religion of Jesus
Christ alone which has given to us our high estate. How much we owe
to the training of Christian mothers! Let us pity and stoop to lift
up these ignorant ones. Send out those who can carry the glad tidings
and point to the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.</p>

<p>Let us do all we can to teach them what the pure religion is. But we
cannot stop here. We must teach them how to use it. "Woman's work for
woman," surely, for this must be done in the homes.</p>

<p>Freedom gave them the <i>right</i> to establish homes! They did the best
they knew how, many of them, but they needed teaching&mdash;they need it
to-day. They must be taught thrift and industry, and cleanliness and
order. They want someone to come to them and help them to transform
their huts into homes. Could you see their rags, their ugly,
misshapen garments, you would agree with me that the women and girls
greatly need to be taught the use of the needle.</p>

<p>Of course Christian schools need to be multiplied among them, where
the rudiments of an English education shall be thoroughly given,
where sewing and cooking, the care of the house and the care of the
sick shall be carefully taught the girls, where the boys may learn
the use of tools and all that pertains to good farming.</p>

<p>Our stronghold is the children. We can never eradicate the evils
existing among the older generation. Slavery left too much ignorance
and superstition to ever be driven from the minds of those who lived
under its sway. But we are responsible for the coming generations.</p>

<p>The American Missionary Association aims to reach the young and meet
their needs by the workers sent out.</p>

<p>Perhaps our work in Savannah will be illustrative of that done in
many other parts of the field. We have there established a church and
school. There are now in school over 200 pupils. The majority of
these remain long enough with us to obtain a good common-school
education. We have also a normal grade, where methods of teaching are
taught those who desire to fit themselves for teachers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> Besides this
we have fitted up a sewing-room, where the girls learn every part of
sewing and repairing, cutting and basting. Many schools have shops
for boys; we look forward to the time when we may be able to have
them, too.</p>

<p>We are just establishing a reading-room. Those who have read Prof.
Salisbury's article in the November <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> understand how much
this is needed. In our present circumstances we arrange it so that
all pupils of higher grades have a daily reading hour, with teacher
to direct. Then once in two weeks the older pupils meet for a social
reading.</p>

<p>In our devotional exercises and school prayer meetings we aim to
assist them in a knowledge of true religion. Last year we observed
the Week of Prayer, and in the daily meetings held for several weeks
some found the way to Christ and Christian life. Our Church and
Sunday-School work reaches many who are not connected with our
school. We have a devoted missionary who spends her time in visiting
the parents and children in their homes, ministering to the wants of
the sick and needy, and holding Bible and Missionary meetings.</p>

<p>This is a bare outline of our work. I presume many of you are saying.
"Have there been no results during these last twenty years?" Oh yes,
we have a bright side to the picture. When we are tired and
discouraged, and wonder if harvest time will never come, we go to
some of the pleasant homes where great changes have been wrought. We
point to a scholar and tell her past history, and then thank God that
the seed sown found a lodging place and good soil.</p>

<p>In the cities when the large schools are, and where there are fair
public schools&mdash;where there is constant contact with civilized life,
many of the colored people live well. Yet there may be a neat, cosy
home just across the street, and a few doors beyond, a wretched
hovel.</p>

<p>In the country, when the "Teachers' Home" and little school house are
built beside their log cabins, they catch a glimpse of better things
than they have known. The modest house, freshly painted, with the
neat, cosy rooms inside&mdash;very simple and plain to us&mdash;seems like a
palace to them. They begin to want the same. The children go to
school and come home with wonderful things to tell. Faces and hands
become clean, the woolly heads are more carefully combed, rents are
mended, the girls put on clean collars.</p>

<p>The missionary shows the women how to fashion home-made lounges and
stools, they are covered with some bright calico, the floor is
scrubbed white, and they begin to live. The teacher says that they
must work if they want to have homes, money begins to be saved, and
before you know it little frame houses are going up beside the old
cabin. A good horse or mule, with a bright shiny buggy, takes the
place of the old steer and cart.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, much has been accomplished. But we had very few workers
in the early days among four million people, although just as many as
could be supported with the means furnished, and to-day, among nearly
seven millions, we have but 336 workers.</p>

<p>Millions sit in darkness right here in our own land. A mighty work is
to be done, and the work in Africa must be done largely by these
people, too.</p>

<p>We need more money; Christian men and women to go forth, and
Christian men and women who are willing to send them. "The harvest
truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Pray ye therefore the
Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his
harvest." "He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
life eternal."</p>

<h3>REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.</h3>


<p>The information from the field, to which you have listened, explains
to you the necessity for the organization of a Bureau of Woman's
Work. It was organized in April, 1883, for the purpose, as was then
stated:</p>

<p>1. To give information to the ladies in the churches of the variety
of work sustained by the Association and to assist in devising plans
of help.</p>

<p>2. To promote correspondence with churches, Sabbath-schools,
missionary societies or individuals who will undertake work of a
special character, such as the support of missionaries, aiding of
students, supplying clothing, furnishing goods, and meeting other
wants on mission ground.</p>

<p>3. To send to the churches, conferences or associations desiring it,
experienced and intelligent lady missionaries to address them, giving
fuller details of our methods of work.</p>

<p>It was believed that the growing interest on the part of the ladies
of our churches, and their evident disposition to aid more
effectively in the elevation of women, particularly the women of the
South, called for such a department. Already the ladies of one State
had organized the "Woman's Aid to the A. M. A.," that they might have
their definite line of work in the support of lady missionaries, and
inquiry had been made by many how best to assist in this work.</p>

<p>It was recognized that in no other way could a general interest be
awakened and maintained so well as by giving direct information from
the field, and the twenty years' experience of the Association in the
South, during which time more than 3,000 different ladies had been
employed as missionaries and teachers, the knowledge gained of the
peculiarities of the field and best methods of reaching the people,
and the thorough organization of the different departments of labor
in home, school, and church, prepared us to bring before the ladies
the information necessary, and to offer most excellent opportunities
for special work for women. The ready response to this movement
confirms the wisdom of the step, and we trust that ere long the
Bureau will open new avenues of usefulness to the ladies of the
churches, and give enlargement and efficiency to the work in the
field.</p>

<p>Immediately following the organization of the Bureau, Miss Rose
Kinney, of Oberlin, O., for many years engaged in the Southern work,
and recently located in one of the dark corners of the field,
McIntosh, Ga., was detailed for service in the North. She spent about
six weeks in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Iowa, addressing ladies'
meetings at the General Associations, and with good results. In June
the Secretary of the Bureau was present at the State Conferences of
Vermont and Maine, and gave information of the work in the field,
resulting in the appointment of a State Committee of ladies in
Vermont, to secure funds for the support of a missionary. Early in
September Miss Anna M. Cahill, for nine years connected with Fisk
University, Nashville, Tenn., was detailed for special service, and
has recently attended a series of meetings in Michigan and Illinois.</p>

<p>It is our purpose thus to bring the work before the ladies whenever
and wherever opportunity is given, through different teachers and
missionaries whom we may be able to spare temporarily from the field.</p>

<p>Within the year just closed, Sept. 30, the Association has had
special aid from ladies North in the support of seven missionaries,
as follows:</p>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Total</td>
  <td align="right" valign="bottom">$2,426.05</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>In this connection we would mention also that a lady missionary, Miss
Clary, at Beaufort, S. C., was sustained to the amount of $300 by the
Sunday-school of the Central Congregational Church, Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Supplies in the furnishing of Mission Homes and dormitories have been
recently furnished, and there is very marked increase of aid in the
furnishing of clothing, both new and second-hand, for the benefit of
students who are struggling in the greatest poverty to obtain an
education.</p>

<p>While, therefore, but a few months have elapsed since the
organization of the Bureau of Woman's Work, its advantage is already
manifest.</p>

<p>Since the field of missionary operations in our own country is large
and diversified, and three leading societies exist, each having its
distinct and important work,&mdash;viz.: The New West Education
Commission, the American Home Missionary Society, and the American
Missionary Association&mdash;no effort has been made by the American
Missionary Association to organize local societies auxiliary to
itself; but that a society should exist in every church, able to
co-operate directly with this Association in its great work for the
Chinese, the Indians, the negroes and the needy whites of the South,
seems apparent.</p>

<p>To this end we urge upon the ladies, organization, as helpful to
systematic giving, and to facilitate such movement we present a form
of constitution for a co-operative society, that may be open to the
call from all parts of our country. This we greatly prefer as
avoiding complication and preserving fellowship and unity in the home
work. Such is the pressure of claims upon us, however, through the
needs of our field, that except as such opportunity is afforded for
aid to the Am. Miss. Assoc., we feel that we may be constrained to
ask for organization auxiliary to the A. M. A. exclusively&mdash;for the
women and children of 6,000,000 of colored people of the South alone
presents a field for missionary work in the elevation of women, which
we must not ignore, from the responsibility of which we cannot
escape.</p>

<p>We are just now entering upon a new year of work. Of the 175 ladies
appointed to the various departments of missionary labor, twelve are
engaged for special home visitation among the people. You can see at
a glance that this number is insufficient for that line of duty.
Although our teachers are missionaries, and accomplish much through
the schools and various agencies set at work for the elevation of the
people, yet we ought to have at least one experienced and efficient
woman at every mission station, whose entire time should be given to
special work in the homes of the people. Not only do we desire this,
but the most urgent appeals are sent us from the field for help of
this kind, not instead of that which we are doing in school and
church, but supplementary to it, as necessary in securing the results
we seek. Already fifteen applications are before us for lady
missionaries to work in the homes, and we wait only for the women of
the North to furnish us the necessary funds. As fast as we receive
pledges of support the missionaries will be sent out.</p>

<p>May the heart of every Christian woman be quickened to new impulse
for the development of womanhood in those in our own land, so
degraded and helpless!</p>

<h3>THE BUREAU IN THE WEST.</h3>

<div class="center">BY MISS ANNA M. CAHILL.</div>


<p>One main object of the Woman's Bureau, as stated at the time of its
organization, is to diffuse information among the ladies of our
churches, as to our work in its various departments.</p>

<p>The carrying out of this purpose led to my eight weeks of itineracy
among the conferences and churches of Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>

<p>If I went to inform I went also to learn&mdash;to see how fares our cause
in these churches. Especially I sought to learn how strong a hold the
work of the American Missionary Association has upon the sympathy and
effort of the Christian ladies of that section, what organized system
of helpfulness they already have in this line, or what in their
judgment can be done and will be done toward incorporating this work
in their regular plan of missionary operations for each year.</p>

<p>As I expected, I found the interest in our cause in various stages of
development. It is not strange that in some places the ladies did not
even so much as know that there was a Woman's Bureau. The Bureau is
in its infancy, and the fact of its existence has not yet taken hold
of us all in any practical way. In many churches&mdash;not by any means
always the larger ones&mdash;I found an intelligent appreciation of the
needs and claims of the South.</p>

<p>We have had many workers from these States of the West, or rather of
the Interior, and when I had the pleasure of going into a community
that had sent out one or more to the work in some part of our field,
I found always an enthusiastic interest and a warm response to my
appeals.</p>

<p>My introduction to the warm-hearted Christian people of Wisconsin was
at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> State Association, met at Racine Sept. 24. Finding on my
arrival a large representation of ladies gathered to celebrate the
anniversary of their Foreign Missionary Society, I felt sure that
there must be also an active sympathy for the work in our own land,
and I was not disappointed. On the following day, at a special
gathering of the ladies, a State society was organized, whose range
of objects should include all the benevolent societies of our
denomination, working in this country, leaving conferences and local
organizations at liberty to contribute through one treasurer or
several treasurers, to any of these societies.</p>

<p>After attending this "gathering of the tribes" it was my privilege to
go by invitation to a few of the towns in southern Wisconsin. Of
course the State organization has not yet stretched out its arms over
the State in the formation of local societies. I can but think that
Beloit, Whitewater, Geneva and Kenosha will be among the first to
take definite steps in this direction. Wisconsin has by special
contributions from her ladies supported a missionary in the South for
several years and is still doing so. When through regular channels of
organization they shall make this a part of their regular yearly
charity, the arrangement can be more permanently relied upon by the
Woman's Bureau. Many, I think, will endorse the sentiment of a
prominent lady in Michigan who said to me: "I think the ladies of
each one of these Western States ought to support one or more
teacher-missionaries under the Association."</p>

<p>On the 9th of October, at Grand Rapids, I joined the representative
of the Woman's Department of the American Home Missionary Society,
with whom the longer tour of six weeks was to be made in Michigan. We
were then on our way to the Grand River Conference at Allendale,
where we found a hearty welcome. In this Conference there is a branch
of the State Woman's Home Missionary Society, a society already more
than a year old and organized on the same broad platform as that
adopted in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Before the meeting of the Southern Michigan Conference we were able
to visit, in rapid succession, the churches at Middleville,
Vermontville, and Olivet, in all of which an evident sympathy in the
various forms of our work led me to hope that increased effort might
result from this new presentation of our needs.</p>

<p>In the Southern Conference we found also a branch organization, union
in its character, and so efficiently officered that all is likely to
be done that can be accomplished through it. Nowhere did I find
stancher friends for our Christian educational work in the South than
in this conference.</p>

<p>At this point a short break occurred in our Michigan tour. A rapid
journey brought us to Lake City in time to spend one day at the
Minnesota State Association&mdash;just to grasp the hands of our Minnesota
friends and be assured of their continued helpfulness. The Woman's
Home Missionary Society voted that at the next annual meeting the
constitution should be reconsidered, with a view to enlarging its
borders and including all the benevolent societies of our home work.
The giving of a year's notice before any change can be made is
required by the constitution itself.</p>

<p>We took up the work in Michigan again at St. Joseph, and from there
went to the Kalamazoo Association. We found here, as elsewhere, that
these autumn conferences are generally held with the smaller and less
accessible churches, where the attendance of ladies is necessarily
limited, and we must, therefore, give our message to the pastors,
charging them with the responsibility of carrying it to the ladies of
their churches.</p>

<p>Before the next conference we were able to take in our plan the
central points, Jackson, Ann Arbor, Flint and Lansing, and when we
went up from there to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Nashville to the Marshall Conference we felt
that we were meeting old friends in the pastors and people, at whose
homes we had already been.</p>

<p>Another tour through Kalamazoo, Allegan, Owosso, Port Huron, St.
Clair, Detroit, Union City and Chelsea brought us much the same
experiences as before.</p>

<p>We came finally to the large Eastern Conference, which was to be our
last place of labor in Michigan. The ladies of this Conference,
though not yet organized for home work under the State society, for
several years supported a missionary in the South, largely through
the personal effort of one active lady, who made this special
collection her care. With the closing of this Bureau visit to the
ladies of Michigan the work is left in their hands&mdash;not to be
forgotten by them, but to be developed and strengthened until there
shall be a rich annual fruitage of effort and practical result.</p>

<h3>CHRISTMAS GIVING AT MYSTIC, CONN.</h3>

<div class="center">REV. CHARLES H. OLIPHANT.</div>


<p>The Editor has asked me to give some account of the way our
Sunday-school behaves itself at Christmas-time.</p>

<p>There are two ideas about the Church; and as parents feel and think
about the Church the children will be pretty sure to think and feel
about the Sunday-school. One conception of the Church is that it is a
kind of receptacle for pious people. When one becomes "good enough"
he is expected to get into this receptacle and there be acted upon by
the means of grace. It is one of the mischiefs of this notion that it
seems to excuse laymen from any active part in Christian work, if
only they are regular attendants upon divine service. So, many people
come to the preaching and the praying as if there were nothing for
them to do, nothing either great or small. Such members may be said
to be found in the "passive voice."</p>

<p>The other and better notion is that the Church is not a receptacle,
but an engine; not a box for Christians to get into, but a "body" for
them to operate, and through which Christ can act upon the world of
to-day. According to this view, the minister is not the only member
whom the Master has called into His vineyard, the ideal Church is not
so much a company of sheep as a company of soldiers; the congregation
comes together not simply to "hear Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," but to organize for
work. This may be called the Church's "active voice." I cannot
(within the verbal limits assigned me) measure the miles of distance
which lie between these two views.</p>

<p>The same confusion of thought prevails in the Sunday-school. We know
how the small boy finds that Sunday-school the most attractive (and
that teacher the "nicest") whose Christmas-tree pays the largest
dividend.</p>

<span class="caption">CHILDREN BEARING CHRISTMAS GIFTS</span>
</div>

<p>When I came to my present field of work it had been the immemorial
custom to have a tree and a treat for the children of the school.
After a year or two of competition with other schools in making it
"worth while" for children to attend our own, we "braced up" and put
the question to vote whether we would make the Christmas festival a
feast for ourselves or a feast for others; whether we would have our
school at this time a dispenser of sweetmeats and ourselves the
beneficiaries, or dispense a gift instead to some more needy servants
of the Master, who had no parental pocketbook to tap; no good things
to give away. To the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> surprise of all the vote was unanimous against
the old, and in favor of the new, way. There was much misgiving as to
results. Many confidently predicted that the offerings (each class
was invited to bring its own in a sealed envelope) would be
microscopic. It was distinctly understood that no money&mdash;not the
smallest sum&mdash;was asked from those who disapproved the plan. Teachers
were urged to dissuade their classes from perfunctory gifts.
Inquiring next for a suitable object, we were advised by the Home
Missionary Society of a poor servant of theirs in a Western State,
whose poorer and more to be pitied wife was the mother of seven
children. We put her to vote, and she was promptly and unanimously
chosen. With the introduction into the plan of a personal element,
enthusiasm began, and it became evident at once that there was to be
sharp rivalry between the classes as to the size of their gifts. At
length came the Christmas Eve concert, and with it a bright, full
company of children. They never looked so happy, and every one of
them knows that he never was so happy on such an occasion, as when,
class by class, the offerings were handed to the Superintendent. With
each of these a passage of Scripture was recited. It became only too
evident, as the pile within his hand increased, that the
prognostications of those who were sure that an old Sunday-school
could not be taught new tricks were false. We are a small
school&mdash;only 80 scholars&mdash;but the class offerings on this occasion
footed up twenty-eight dollars and some cents. A letter was
accordingly written and the money inclosed to the wife (this was the
best part of it, for we were sure that the minister could not then,
as ministers will, mistake the remittance for a portion of his
salary), who was asked to purchase with the amount some article or
articles of which she was individually in need. The letter which came
back to us after a week made those who heard it read in open school
clear their throats and wink away an inevitable tear. It revealed
(among other things) the fact that this poor servant had hitherto
made all the clothing for seven children with the bare needle. Now
she has a sewing machine. We all think, but none more fervently than
the children, that the memory of a few oranges, more or less&mdash;oranges
eaten three years ago&mdash;would not compensate for the glad
consciousness that life is easier every day in at least one prairie
home. Thus we were led to translate the Beatitude pronounced upon the
"giver" into our own experience, and we have its meaning in the
continuous stream of happiness which many have felt at the
remembrance of what our pennies wrought.</p>

<p>We have recently chosen an object for this year's offering; for the
practice of giving and not receiving at Christmas-time is now
habitual with us. Dr. Pike has told us about Philip Page, the African
lad now at Atlanta, seeking eagerly, but with insufficient means,
such an education as will qualify him to go back to his people a
missionary. We shall send him enough for his support for one, and
perhaps for two months.</p>

<p>Let me urge those who may read these words to allow no seeming
obstacle to prevent the putting in practice, in the schools to which
they belong, of the plan here described. Do not fail to give the
children for their Christmas gift the happiness that giving brings.
Do not delay to teach the young by so simple a lesson the difference
between the blessedness of giving and that of receiving. Identify by
all means the aims and methods of the Church and Sunday-school. Let
it not, even in a figure, appear to the child that the Christian
attitude is one of idle enjoyment. No matter how small the gift, it
is the <i>giving up</i> which makes us the Lord's disciples.</p>

<h3>CONSTITUTION.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. I. This society shall be called the American Missionary
Association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. II. The object of this Association shall be to conduct Christian
missionary and educational operations and diffuse a knowledge of the
Holy Scriptures in our own country and other countries which are
destitute of them, or which present open and urgent fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. III. Members of evangelical churches may be constituted members
of this Association for life by the payment of thirty dollars into
its treasury, with the written declaration at the time or times of
payment that the sum is to be applied to constitute a designated
person a life member; and such membership shall begin sixty days
after the payment shall have been completed. Other persons, by the
payment of the same sum, may be made life members without the
privilege of voting.</p>

<p>Every evangelical church which has within a year contributed to the
funds of the Association and every State Conference or Association of
such churches may appoint two delegates to the Annual Meeting of the
Association; such delegates, duly attested by credentials, shall be
members of the Association for the year for which they were thus
appointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. IV. The Annual Meeting of the Association shall be held in the
month of October or November, at such time and place as may be
designated by the Association, or, in case of its failure to act, by
the Executive Committee, by notice printed in the official
publication of the Association for the preceding month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. V. The officers of the Association shall be a President, five
Vice-Presidents, a Corresponding Secretary or Secretaries, a
Recording Secretary, a Treasurer, Auditors, and an Executive
Committee of fifteen members, all of whom shall be elected by ballot.</p>

<p>At the first Annual Meeting after the adoption of this Constitution,
five members of the Executive Committee shall be elected for the term
of one year, five for two years and five for three years, and at each
subsequent Annual Meeting, five members shall be elected for the full
term of three years, and such others as shall be required to fill
vacancies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. VI. To the Executive Committee shall belong the collecting and
disbursing of funds, the appointing, counseling, sustaining and
dismissing of missionaries and agents, and the selection of
missionary fields. They shall have authority to fill all vacancies in
office occurring between the Annual Meetings; to apply to any
Legislature for acts of incorporation, or conferring corporate
powers; to make provision when necessary for disabled missionaries
and for the widows and children of deceased missionaries, and in
general to transact all such business as usually appertains to the
Executive Committees of missionary and other benevolent societies.
The acts of the Committee shall be subject to the revision of the
Annual Meeting.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee constitute a quorum for transacting
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. VII. No person shall be made an officer of this Association who
is not a member of some evangelical church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. VIII. Missionary bodies and churches or individuals may appoint
and sustain missionaries of their own, through the agency of the
Executive Committee, on terms mutually agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art</span>. IX. No amendment shall be made to this Constitution except by
the vote of two-thirds of the members present at an Annual Meeting
and voting, the amendment having been approved by the vote of a
majority at the previous Annual Meeting.</p>

</p>

<p><i>Mr. C. N. Crittenton:</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I wish to call your attention to the good your Sulphur Soap
has done me. For nearly fourteen years I have been troubled with a
skin humor resembling salt rheum. I have spent nearly a small fortune
for doctors and medicine, but with only temporary relief. I commenced
using your "Glenn's Sulphur Soap" nearly two years ago&mdash;<b>used it in
baths and as a toilet soap daily. My skin is now as clear as an
infant's, and no one would be able to tell that I ever had a skin
complaint.</b> I would not be without the soap if it cost five times the
amount. Yours respectfully.

</p>

<p>The above testimonial is indisputable evidence that Glenn's Sulphur
Soap will eliminate poisonous Skin Diseases <span class="smcap">when all other means have
failed</span>. To this fact thousands have testified; and that it will
banish lesser afflictions, such as common <span class="smcap">pimples, eruptions</span> and
<span class="smcap">sores</span>, and keep the skin clear and beautiful, is absolutely certain.
For this reason ladies whose complexions have been improved by the
use of this soap <span class="smcap">now make it a constant toilet appendage</span>. The genuine
always bears the name of C. N. CRITTENTON, 115 Fulton street, New
